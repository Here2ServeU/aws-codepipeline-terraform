# AWS CodePipeline Setup with Terraform

This Terraform code helps you automate your software delivery pipeline easily. It simplifies your workflow and increases efficiency.

Terraform is a powerful tool for safely and efficiently building, changing, and versioning infrastructure. It enables you to codify your infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and automate deployments across different environments. Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure in a declarative configuration language, allowing for easy collaboration and version control.
